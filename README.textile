h2. Erlang WebSocket wrapper for "MochiWeb":http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/

This is a simple wrapper around the mochiweb_socket_server to allow "WebSocket":http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-66 connections.  With this wrapper, you can write WebSocket connection loops just like you'd write a normal mochiweb application. 

The chat server example is actually work in progress (and can be broken anytime), it will be released in a week or so, after a huge refactoring.

h3. Requirements:
 
 # Erlang 12.5 or greater
 # Google Chrome Browser developer channel release 4.0.249.0


h3. Getting Started:
 
 # download the code
 # CD into the erlang_websocket directory
 # run make

h3. Run the cate example:

 # CD into the examples/basic directory
 # run the 'start.sh' script with sudo (the flash policy server needs to bind top port 843).
 # Point the Chrome Browser (or any other if you want to try the Flash fallback) to 'http://localhost:8000'
